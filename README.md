# HackUla
Our project addresses the challenges faced by elderly individuals and those with multiple health
issues, who often struggle to manage medical records, follow medication schedules, and access
emergency support on time. To solve this, we propose a user-friendly mobile app that brings all essential
health information into one place, provides reminders for medicines, check-ups, and insurance renewal, andensures quick access to healthcare services. Users can securely store records, upload reports, and add
caretakers for support, while an emergency button connects directly to ambulances and alerts family members with the user’s live location. The app will support Indian regional languages and include an AIpowered voice assistant for easier use by seniors. It will also help locate nearby hospitals, pharmacies, and
nurses, and provide details on insurance options and rare medicines. With strict focus on privacy and security, the app ensures personal health data is never leaked or misused. The outcome will be a working prototype that empowers the elderly to stay safe, organized, and independent, while enabling caretakers tomanage their loved ones’ healthcare needs more effectively
